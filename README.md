This is a website created for the fictional Company _Florion_. The site was created with a target audience of elder people, so everything is measured to have really good contrasts and sizes. It also allows to change the size of the texts right on the website with the gear on the navbar. The navbar was also made Fixed so it could give the users the ability to always relocate themselves in the website and feel more grounded.

The website is hosted on this same repo on: https://faust0z.github.io/Florion-Final-Website/

Thanks!
