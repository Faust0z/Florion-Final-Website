# This is a website created for the fictional Company _Florion_ on the behalf of a college project. 

### The site was created with a target audience of elder people, so the following considerations were taken:
- Font colors and buttons were measured to have really good contrasts. 
- The navbar was made Fixed so it could give the users the ability to always relocate themselves in the website and feel more grounded.
- The users of the site are able to increase the size of texts right on the website. This can be done with the gear on the navbar.

The website is hosted on this same repo on: https://faust0z.github.io/Florion-Final-Website/

Thanks!
